# NetFlow probe for the bare-metal vz host (nikopol-vz).
#
# The traffic the operator wants to account for — the MacBook's own uplink to
# the Android hotspot — only exists on the bare metal's physical Wi-Fi (en0): a
# Tart guest bridged to that Wi-Fi never sees the host's own unicast (switched
# L2), so the probe MUST run on the bare metal, not in a VM.
#
# We use pmacct's `pmacctd` (libpcap capture) with the `nfprobe` plugin rather
# than softflowd: the goal is EXACT byte accounting to match a carrier bill, so
# every flow must be counted — `sampling_rate: 1` (no renormalisation) and a
# per-flow NetFlow v9 record carrying the real cumulative byte count. softflowd
# also could not satisfy Akvorado's enricher gates (it emits no interface index
# and no exporter metadata); pmacct assigns a static ifindex via
# `pcap_ifindex: map` + interfaces.map, which the Akvorado static metadata
# provider then resolves.
#
# nikopol-vz is outside the ndh nix-darwin fleet (it has a nix store + flox but
# no darwin-rebuild activation), so this bundle carries pmacct plus a root
# LaunchDaemon installer that renders the config + interfaces.map + plist at
# deploy time — mirroring how nerd-tart lands a per-VM YAML on the vz host
# rather than baking it into a system module.  It is copied over via the same
# `nix copy` rail as the Tart artifacts (see `netflow-probe-deploy` in flake.nix).
